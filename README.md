# Pokedex
Project made based on video of "Manual Dev". By doing this project I learned many things, i improved my skills with html, css and javascript. More specificallt with the javascript I learned new forms to create a function. And in a basic way learn the use and requests of api's, using the api "PokeApi" to search the name, id and image of the pokemons.
